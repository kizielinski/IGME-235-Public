                        My Work Process
                    </h2>
                    My process for creating my site started with the color scheme. I first visited coolors.co to get an idea of the colors I wanted for the site. Aftwards I chose two colors for a basic header and background color. From there I decided to build my website very similar to the design concepts I drew for my game-treatment. The design concepts were very useful in creating the baseCSSfile that was used for the header, navigation, and footer in each page. After I created the baseCSSfile I then decided to pick a font-family for all the text on the site, except for the documentation and game-treatment pages for readability purposes. The font I chose was Pirata One which is a readable font that has cursive elements and thematically fits with the pirate theme. It adds more of a rustic adventure feel to the home page espcially which draws the user to play the game. After picking the font, I arranged my text and image into two main columns, with the text telling a story leading up to the game, and the image thematically fitting with the story. I added all my content, and after revising my work, I decided to add a bar for the footer, and clean up the hover mechanic of the links in my nav bar. From this point I worked primarily on the content of the project page, inputting in placeholder grid elements until the game is made, and adding to my documentation page last. By this point all my css and styles were valid. Most of the work I did with little help, although I did look at a couple of W3Schools tutorials, and css-tricks for refreshing some concepts. Additionally I did have to use the markdown tutorial as I have never worked with markdown before, but I think it went well.
